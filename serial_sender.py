serial_sender.py - daemon to send G-code to our Matsuura over RS-232

listens on a tcp port for commands, normally from the web server,
while sending data over an RS-232 serial tty port.

Receives json encoded commands e.g.: {"cmd": "start", "file": "1001.nc"}
Response is coded as: {"error": 0, "message": "File Started"}
Error of 0 means no error.  Error of 1, means something is wrong.

Other commands supported are "stop", and "status".  Neither take an argument.
"stop" aborts the current sending file, and "status" returns a text
description of the daemon status (sending, idle, finished send, etc).

Supports simultaneous connections from the network for command and control
but only supports sending data on one RS-232 port.

Notice: This is custom configured to work with the Nova Labs Matsuura with all
it's special needs and requirements, based on how we have the machine
configured. Do not expect it to work correctly for other CNC machines without
careful testing. In addition, the Matsuura MX3 controller has many parameters
that can be adjusted for how it deals with the RS-232 port.  Such as parity,
which it set to ignore now, and the use of RTS/CTS for flow control vs
XON/XOFF (it can support both). And that it uses % to signal the end of
the G-code, not the G-code stop commands, like M30.  This code, is tuned
to work with our Matsuura as configured. Change the Matsuura configuration
and this won't likely work.

To test:

Hook 2 usb serial dongles  up to two ports
connect them with a null modem cable
run this code on one of them
run this on the other one

python3 /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/serial/tools/miniterm.py --rtscts --rts 1 /dev/ttyUSB1 9600
# 9/29 haven't proven RTS/CTS handshake working in above config

See also: serial_receiver.py in this code base.  It is an RS-232 receiver
to replace the miniterm in the above testing procedure and emulates the
behavior of the Matsuura for stopping and starting flow with RTS to prove
that flow control is working and to help diagnose a bug we had with
RS-232 Overflow alarms on the Matsuura.

2021-07-30 This code had a major overall - Curt Welch curt@kcwc.com

Most the code changes dealt with clean handling of errors, which were
not tested for in the old version, like starting a new file, while in
the middle of sending a file, was not prevented in the old.

The RS-232 Overrun alarm bug was fixed by sending not just \n, but both
\r and \n for each line.  The bug was really on the Matsuura side in that
it did not tell the sender to stop sending fast enough, if the data being
sent were very short G-Code blocks like "M06" and "M30".  A string of these
one command blocks at the end of the job triggered the alarm.  I believe
the issue was that the the matsuura didn't expect it to be possible to
encode more than two blocks of G-code lines in less than 10 characters. With
only an on each line, these commands only take 4 characters each, and 10
characters will code more than two blocks.  This is only an educated guess
because the truth is hidden inside the Matsuura.

In addition to sending CR LF to make the commands longer, I also pad any
short lines (like M3) with spaces to make it at least three characters long.

Other changes to the code included reading the entire file into memory and
modifying it, to strip leading blank lines and an optional % start of G-code
symbol, strip all blank lines, strip trailing spaces and CR and LF then
adding spaces to short lines and CR LF to all lines.

The End of code % marker is sent without a CR LF (the Matsuura seems not
to need it, and those can end up being buffered and read at the start of
the next transfer creating confusion for the users).

Code was structured to deal with an odd Matsuura issue when drip feeding.
At the end of job, when the Matsuura halts, on an M30 (or other commands)
it stops reading from the RS-232 and turns RTS off.  If it has not read
the % before this, the % will never be read, and the send file operation
will just hand forever waiting for the Matsuura to read it.  This is mostly
harmless, the user just needs to abort the send with the stop feature. But
it creates the impression that this upload system is flaky, so I worked
to prevent that by adding the % to the end of the last line, instead of sending
it separately, so the last line of the G-code and the % get sent in one
write command to the serial port to increase the odds that the Matsuura will
read the % before it executes teh M30 and stops reading.

A main feature of this new code is that it attempts to prevent the large
OS and USB buffers from filling with G-Code not actually sent on the RS-232
line. Not doing this, creates user confusion when the application say the
file has finished sending, but yet 15K of G-code is still buffered and
being sent. For small files, it can even make the user think the file was
not sent, and cause them to hit the send button again, buffering up 2 copies
of the same code in the OS buffers.  And because the application has no way
to clear these buffers (well, mayne a tty close and re-open would do it?),
the solution I took was to just make sure the OS buffers were never filled
up.

The solution to keeping the OS buffers empty was to never send data faster
than 960 characters per second (after every write, the code will not try
to write again until enough time has passed to allow all those
to be transmitted), and second, to never send if the Matsuura had CTS
turned off, or if the local buffers had any characters backlogged. This
approach works well, but it not perfect.  Because we can't see the size
of the OS buffer, we don't know for sure that we haven't filled it up by
sending too much when the Matsuura was not ready for it.  The highly complex
issue at play, is that when we see the Matsuura ask for data, with a
CTS signal, and we write a big block of data, we might have written too much.
The Matsuura might only hav been willing to accept say 10 chars before it
turned RTS off, but we just sent 50.  If we keep making that mistake, we
OS buffers will fill up and back log.

Because the RTS.CTS works, this is not a hard error. It is ONLY a user
confusion error.  If the user aborts the run (their job is not working),
all the data in the OS buffers will keep being sent. Then when they try
to restart the next job, the old un-sent data is going to be sent to the
Matsuura.  To clear the buffers, the user must go to Memory Edit Mode,
and hit IN and RESET multiple times, to make the matsuura eat the
garbage that has been buffered.  Not a very user friendly result.  Which
is why I worked so hard with this to try and keep the OS buffers empty.

This errors on the side of slowing down the transfer, to gain the advantage
of simpler use, and less confusion, and greater reliability and trust in the
system.

class FileToSend:
    """" File To Send to Matsuura.

        Reads entire file into memory.
        Fixes issues to prep for sending.
        Strips training spaces and \r and \n then adds \r\n at end.
        Ignores/removes blank lines.

        Adds trailing spaces to ensure all lines are at least 3
            characters (not counting CR LF) to fix a timing bug with the
            Matsuura to prevent RS-232 Overrun Alarms.

        Strips % at beginning of file (common G-code convention to
            put % at the beginning and end of code), but we must not
            send it because the Matsuura stops reading on a line that
            begins with %.
            Only works if there are only blank lines before the %.  If
            there are Leader comments, this is not dealt with.

        Looks for % end marker and ignores rest of file.
        Adds % to end of last line to signal end of code.
