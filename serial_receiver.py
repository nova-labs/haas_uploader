serial_receiver.py - debug tool for testing serial_sender.py

Receive characters over an RS-232 connection from serial_sender.py and
manipulate RTS to force the sender to stop and start sending much as how the
Matsuura acts when doing a drip feed.

Can be used on the same computer as serial_sender or a different one. I've
tested with two USB to RS-232 adaptors linked by an RS-232 null modem wire
(cross over wire).

This outputs extensive logging and timing information about what was received,
and will currently turn RTS off (to signal the sender to stop sending), after
each 5 \n characters (RTS_STOP_LINES) received and then turn it back on after
0.5 seconds (RTS_STOP_TIME).

This looks for, and tracks, characters received after the sender was told to
stop to help us under the Matsuura RS-232 Overrun alarms we have seen.  The
Matsuura manual claims the alarm indicates that more than 10 characters were
received.

Results using my MacBook Pro laptop and two FTDI based USB to Serial converters
show the application will consistently receive about 2 to 4 characters after
every stop but the time stamps implies this is not real overrun but rather just
characters buffered in the converter and not sent back over USB until after the
converter was told to set RTS low.  I could not make the serial_sender and
these two converts show any type of error that would explain the Matsuura
alarms.

I did see a few errant cases of receiving many characters as much as 92 ms
after the sender was told to stop, but after more code clean up and more
extensive timing logging added these errant cases seem to have vanished.
